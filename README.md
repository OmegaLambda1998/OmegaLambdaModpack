An expert modpack - skyblock with a twist

Everything is a draft at the moment

## Story
You lived a decent life, not really evil, but not really good either, just alive. When you died you had no terrible sins pulling you down, but no great virtues lifting you up. As such, when it came to your final judgment you were informed that you would be placed in an in-between area, and locked in a state of nothingness. No punishments or rewards, no experiences, no time.
As suche you were rather surprised to find yourself awakening on an island, floating in the sky, with an office right behind you.

## Chapter 0: Where am I?
Exploring the island reveals clues as to its purpose. It appears to be one of the locations the creators, create. Long abandonded as more advanced tools of creation were discovered. However, there may be just enough here to allow you to create a world in which you can escape. You find that you can not break or place anything in here, but after some exploring, you discover an "Onboarding Guide for new Creators" (Quest Book). This guides you through the facility, collecting various materials (7 dirt [d], a bucket of water [w], and a sapling [s]) in order to create a "Void World Disc"

Void World Disc = 
```
[ d | s | d ]
[ d | w | d ]
[ d | d | d ]
```

Using the disc transports you to the void world (skyblock) where you are finally able to manipulate the world around you.

## Chapter 1: Starting from Nothing
The goal of this chapter is to automate the most basic resources - Dirt, Cobblestone, Stone, Wood, Charcoal. Combining these together will allow you to create the "Overworld Disc" which will allow you access to the Overworld, and the resources therein.

## Chapter 2: The Overworld
This introduces you to the first tech and magic mods, as well as access to all the resources of the Overworld.
